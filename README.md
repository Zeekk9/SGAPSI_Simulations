# SGAPSI_Simulations

**Numerical Simulations, Noise Analysis, and Comparisons of the SG-APSI Method**

This repository contains code used for the numerical analysis, noise robustness evaluation, and comparison of the **N-Step Self-Calibrated Generalized Amplitude-Phase-Shifting Interferometry (SG-APSI)** technique.

---

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.11.7  
- Recommended: [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) distribution  
- Alternatively, install the following packages manually:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `random`
  - `time`

---

## üóÇ File Structure & Usage

- **`1_Carre.py`**, **`2_PCA.py`**, **`3_VES.py`**, **`4_SCAPSI.py`**  
  Implementations of phase-retrieval methods:
  - Carr√© Method
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - Volume Enclosed by a Surface (VES)
  - Self-Calibrated SG-APSI (proposed method)

  Each script generates simulation data stored in `.npz` files.

- **`0_Comparation_Plots.py`**  
  Loads and compares the results from the four methods using the generated datasets.  
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è If you change the noise levels, **re-run all four method scripts** before executing this script.

## üîß Configuring Noise Levels

Noise parameters can be customized directly in each method script:

```python
A_noise_level = 0.01        # Amplitude noise (e.g., 0.01 = 10% error)
phi_noise_level = 1e-9      # Phase noise (e.g., ~10 degrees)
row = 100                   # Row index used for simulation and analysis
